We are thrilled to announce the launch of the **new ACSOS website**! This redesign represents a significant step forward in how we communicate with our community and share information about the conference.

## What's New?

The new website is built with **Astro**, a modern web framework that delivers lightning-fast performance. Here are some of the key improvements:

*   **Performance**: Faster load times and better responsiveness on mobile devices.
*   **Design**: A clean, modern aesthetic that aligns with the ACSOS brand.
*   **Navigation**: Improved menu structure to help you find information quickly.
*   **Content**: A dedicated section for newsletters and updates (like this one!).

## Why the Change?

As the ACSOS community continues to grow, we needed a platform that could scale with us. The old website served us well, but it was time for a refresh. We wanted to create a space that not only looks good but also provides a seamless user experience for researchers, practitioners, and students alike.

### Key Features

1.  **Dynamic News Section**: Stay up-to-date with the latest announcements.
2.  **Conference Archive**: Easily access proceedings and information from past conferences.
3.  **Community Highlights**: Showcasing awards, leadership, and community achievements.

We hope you enjoy the new site! If you have any feedback or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out to the web chair.
