## Keynote 1: The Future of Self-Adaptive AI

**Speaker:** Dr. Jane Doe, *University of Tech*

**Abstract:**
As Artificial Intelligence becomes more pervasive, the need for systems that can adapt to changing environments and data distributions is critical. In this talk, Dr. Doe will explore the intersection of self-adaptation and AI, discussing recent advancements in continual learning and robust AI systems. She will present a vision for "Self-Adaptive AI" that can operate reliably in the open world.

**Bio:**
Dr. Jane Doe is a Professor of Computer Science at the University of Tech. Her research focuses on machine learning, adaptive systems, and robotics. She is a Fellow of the IEEE and has received numerous awards for her work.

## Keynote 2: Engineering Emergence in Swarm Systems

**Speaker:** Prof. John Smith, *Institute of Science*

**Abstract:**
Swarm systems, composed of many simple interacting agents, can exhibit complex and useful global behaviors. However, engineering these systems to guarantee specific outcomes remains a challenge. Prof. Smith will discuss new methodologies for designing and verifying swarm behaviors, drawing inspiration from biological systems like ant colonies and bird flocks.

**Bio:**
Prof. John Smith is the Director of the Institute of Science. He is a pioneer in the field of swarm intelligence and has authored over 200 papers on the subject.
