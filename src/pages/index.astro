					<h2>About ACSOS</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					The IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing and Self-Organizing Systems (ACSOS) 
					was founded as a merger of the IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing (ICAC) 
					and the IEEE International Conference on Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems (SASO). 
					The goal of the ACSOS is to provide a forum for sharing the latest research results, ideas 
					and experiences in autonomic computing, self-adaptation and self-organization.
				</p>

				<p>
					Large-scale systems of all types, such as data centers, computer clouds, smart cities, 
					cyber-physical systems, sensor networks, and embedded or pervasive environments, are becoming 
					increasingly complex and burdensome for people to manage. The complexity of current and emerging 
					networks, software and services, especially in dealing with dynamics in the environment and 
					problem domain, has led the software engineering, distributed systems and resource management 
					communities to look for inspiration in diverse fields (e.g., complex systems, control theory, 
					artificial intelligence, sociology, and biology) to find new ways of designing and managing 
					such computing systems.
				</p>

				<p>
					In this endeavor, a number of research problems and challenges exist related to engineering 
					systems, networks and services based on principles from autonomic computing, self-adaptation 
					and self-organization. One challenge in self-adaptation is to identify how to change a specific 
					behavior to achieve the desired improvement in a reliable manner. Another challenge is how to 
					predict and control emergent global system behavior resulting from self-organization. To address 
					these challenges, novel modeling techniques are needed that help to understand the mapping from 
					local behavior to global behavior, as well as the inverse relationship. Such models are a key 
					condition for understanding, controlling, and designing emergent behavior in autonomic systems.
				</p>

				<p>
					The mission of ACSOS is to bring together researchers and industry practitioners that address 
					these challenges to make resources, applications and systems more autonomic, self-adaptive and 
					self-organizing. ACSOS provides a forum to share and present their experiences, discuss challenges, 
					and report state-of-the-art and in-progress research in all areas related to autonomic computing, 
					self-adaptation and self-organization.
